1. Art, with Ordis supporting him with psionics, infiltrates a town that has been taken over by a cult. Dialogue between Art and Ordis will explain that Ordis has been jumping from mind to mind to investigate the cult, and that his partnership with Art is a recent development (but the two knew eachother in the past.) Upon entering the basement of the town hall, Art will find that the cultists were trying to breech the planar walls and pull a demon out of Jontask, a prison plane. Art asks Ordis whether a similar ritual could be used to get the Archons back, but Ordis tells him that that might void the seal on both groups. Art notes that none of the cultists had magical defences, and Ordis tells Art that he couldn't feel a magical mind. The pair conclude that further investigation is necessary.

2.

A. While investigating the Baron, Ordis vaguely mentions that he felt something, but dismisses it. Art presses him on the feeling, reasoning that he should trust his instincts. Ordis eventually obliges, but investigates the feeling too late. Towards the end of the mission, Ordis discovers that his location has been compromised by a rival psion, which he thought to be an impossibility (he should be the only one.) Art tells Ordis to move, and he does so, but feels minds closing in on him soon after. Art begins to get antsy and argues for aborting the mission so that he can assist Ordis, but Ordis tells Art to follow through. He does so -- quickly -- but isn't airbourne in time to stop Ordis from being snatched. Art instead flies to Margret, another of the Sentinels and a very powerful witch. She attempts to call upon the spirits to divine the whereabouts of Ordis (despite an apparent rivalry). During her divination process, she seems to be possessed by a prohpetic spirit who instructs Art to find an ancient dwarven sword (cold iron) and the final gift from the gods (kept on a warded island in the sky).

B. Art breaks on to a sky pirate ship with a literal skeleton crew in order to go to the crypt containing the God's final gift.
